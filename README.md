File Operations has 3 operations it can execute: 

1. Reads a file and returns an error if the process doesn't work, or returns the file contents if the process works.

2. Writes specified content to a file, it will create a file if the file does not already exist,
or replace the file content with the new content if the file does exist.

3. Deletes a specified file or returns an error if the file does not exist.

Server has a route to display a list of all workouts, a POST route to handle the creation of a new workout and adds it to the workouts array, a PUT route to handle an update of a workout based on its ID, and a DELETE route to handle the deletion of a workout based on its ID. Server also has a filtering feature which works by using a query parameter to check for the name and filter the workouts by name if the name is in the query parameters. Another feature Server has is a sorting feature which works by using a query parameter to check for sorting and sort the workouts by name if the value of sort is 'name'. Server has versioning for the APIs and a global error handler.

Node.js Event Loop:

Node.js can support thousands of concurrent connections without the use of multi-threading since it runs on a single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O requests.

The event loop works by:

1. Execute script, which may execute async calls
2. Execute the callbacks
3. Re-enter the event loop

The updated code includes a React component called `StepTracker` that interacts with a server built using Express and MongoDB. Here's an overview of what the code does:

1:
   - Establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
   - Defines a schema and model for a `Step` collection in the database.

2:
   - Sets up an Express server with endpoints for fetching and adding steps to the MongoDB database.
   - The server runs on `http://localhost:3000/`.

3:
   - Integrates MongoDB operations into a React application using Axios for HTTP requests.
   - Provides a `StepTracker` component that fetches and displays steps from the server.
   - Allows users to add new steps through a form.
