This is a basic React app that allows the user to fetch, view, and add exercises.

Fetch Exercises: When initialized, the app retrieves a list of exercises from a predefined API endpoint.

Display Exercises: Exercises are listed on the main screen. In case no exercises are fetched, a prompt asks the user to add some.

Add New Exercises: Users can input the name of a new exercise and add it to the list. The new addition is reflected immediately on the UI.

Refresh Functionality: A refresh button allows users to re-fetch the list of exercises from the API.
